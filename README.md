### Ingredients

For 4 servings:

- Ladyfingers biscuits 125 g (Sugar sprinkled is better)
- Mascarpone cheese 250 g
- Fresh eggs 2 (should be fresh!)
- Sugar 50 g
- Espresso coffee 100 ml
- Dark chocolate flakes
- Unsweetened cocoa powder

### Steps

1. Prepare the espresso coffee and let it cool down.
2. Bring the mascarpone cheese to room temperature.
3. Separate the egg yolks from the whites.
4. In the yolk bowl, add the half of the sugar to the egg yolks and whisk until the yolks become pale and creamy.
5. Add the mascarpone cheese to the egg yolks and whisk until smooth and creamy.
6. Clean and dry the whisk not to contaminate fat into the egg whites.
7. In the white bowl, add the remaining sugar in three batches while whisking the whites until stiff peaks form.
8. Add yolk mixture to the whites in three batches and fold gentry from bottom to top with whisk until well combined.
9. Break biscuits in half and soak them in the coffee 2 seconds, then place them in the bottom of the serving glasses.
10. Add a layer of mascarpone cream on top of the biscuits, then sprinkle with dark chocolate flakes.
11. Repeat the process until the glasses are full.
12. Sprinkle the top with unsweetened cocoa powder.

### Notes

- If the mascarpone cheese is too cold, it will not dissolve completely.
  It is important to bring it to room temperature before using it.
