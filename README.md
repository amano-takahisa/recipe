### Ingredients

For 4 servings:

- Ladyfingers biscuits 125 g (Sugar sprinkled is better)
- Mascarpone cheese 250 g
- Fresh eggs 2 (should be fresh!)
- Sugar 50 g
- Espresso coffee 100 ml
- Dark chocolate flakes
- Unsweetened cocoa powder

### Steps

1. Prepare the espresso coffee and let it cool down.
2. Bring the mascarpone cheese to room temperature.
3. Separate the egg yolks from the whites.
4. In the yolk bowl, add the half of the sugar to the egg yolks and whisk until the yolks become pale and creamy.
5. Add the mascarpone cheese to the egg yolks and whisk until smooth and creamy.
6. Clean and dry the whisk not to contaminate fat into the egg whites.
7. In the white bowl, add the remaining sugar in three batches while whisking the whites until stiff peaks form.
8. Add yolk mixture to the whites in three batches and fold gentry from bottom to top with whisk until well combined.
9. Break biscuits in half and soak them in the coffee 2 seconds, then place them in the bottom of the serving glasses.
10. Add a layer of mascarpone cream on top of the biscuits, then sprinkle with dark chocolate flakes.
11. Repeat the process until the glasses are full.
12. Sprinkle the top with unsweetened cocoa powder.

### Notes

- If the mascarpone cheese is too cold, it will not dissolve completely.
  It is important to bring it to room temperature before using it.

## Parsnip soup

The quantity of ingredients can be adjusted appropriately.
Only the saltiness should be adjusted by tasting.

### Steps

2. Heat the butter or olive oil in a pot, add the onions, and cook them until they become brown.
3. Add the parsnips and water to the pot, and cook them until they become soft (20-30 min).
4. Blend the parsnips and onions with a blender until smooth.
5. Add milk to the pot and heat it.
6. Add salt to taste.

## Tofu from soy beans

### Ingredients

For one block of tofu

- Soy beans 300 g
- Water 1.5 L
- Nigari 1 tsp

### Steps

1. Soak the soy beans in water for 12 hours.
   When the beans are soaked, the split surface of soy beans should be flat.
2. Blend the soy beans with water until smooth.
3. Heat the soy bean paste in a pot until it becomes boiling, and keep boiling for 10 min.
4. Filter the soy bean paste with a cloth and squeeze the soy milk.
   The remaining soy bean paste is called okara, and it can be used for other recipes.
5. Dissolve nigari in half cup of 50 degree Celsius water.
6. Heat the soy milk in a pot until it 75 degree Celsius.
7. Slowly pour the dissolved nigari into the warmed soy milk.
8. Stir the soy milk gently, and stop heating. Keep it warm for 20-30 min.
   Soy milk will separate into tofu and whey.
9. Filter the tofu with a cloth and press it with a weight.
10. Pour the hardened tofu into the tofu box.
11. Put some weight on the tofu box and wait for 1-2 hours.
12. Remove the tofu from the box in a water bowl.

## Apfelzimtschnecken

### Ingredients

For 12-16 pieces:

Dough:
- Flour 500 g
- Sugar 80 g
- Egg 1
- Butter 80 g
- Milk 200 ml
- Yeast 10 g
- Salt 1 tsp

Filling:
- Apple 4
- Sugar 50 g
- Cinnamon 1 tbsp
- Butter 70 g
- Lemon juice 1 tbsp

### Steps

1. Make the dough.
2. Make the filling. Cut the apples into small pieces, and cook them in a pan
   with sugar, cinnamon, butter, and lemon juice until they become soft.
3. Spread the dough on a table, and spread the filling on the dough.
4. Roll the dough with the filling, and cut it into 12-16 pieces.
5. Place the pieces on a baking tray, and bake them in an oven at 160 degree Celsius for 20-30 min.

### Notes

- Slow fermentation of the dough may taste better.
- If the dough is spread thin, it is difficult to roll it out, but it will expand quite a bit when baked.
- Be careful not to overbake. It may be better to bake it only from the top.
